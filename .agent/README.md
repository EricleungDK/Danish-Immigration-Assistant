# Albert - Project Documentation

**Last Updated**: 2026-06-18
**Status**: Tested MVP complete; Qwen-controlled delegation configured; Gemma and repair relaunch workflows live-verified

## Quick Start

1. Read [Project Architecture](System/project_architecture.md) for the current Orchestrator, TUI, and runner boundaries.
2. Follow [Development Workflow](SOP/development_workflow.md) for local development.
3. Check [Current Tasks](Tasks/context.md) for current model registry, completed backlog, and pending cloud live-check work.
4. Run `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` before claiming changes are complete.
